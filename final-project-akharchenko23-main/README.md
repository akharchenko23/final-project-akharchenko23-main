# Final Project: Netflix Dataset Analytics

### ⚠️ To complete this work you have to use PyCharm Professional and Jupyter Notebook ⚠️

## Overview

For your final project in data analysis, you will dive into
the [Netflix dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows). This dataset contains various columns
such as `show_id`, `type`, `title`, `director`, `cast`, `country`, `date_added`, `release_year`, `rating`, `duration`,
`listed_in`, and `description`. Your task will be to perform a comprehensive analysis of the Netflix content landscape,
utilizing the data to uncover insights and trends through visualizations and statistical analysis.

## Visualization:

You are encouraged to use Python for this project, specifically Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization. For
visualization, consider the following libraries, but you are free to explore others:

- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/quick_start.html): A versatile library for creating static,
  animated, and interactive visualizations.
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): Based on Matplotlib, Seaborn facilitates making statistical graphics.
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/statistical-charts/): For interactive, web-based plots.
- [Pandas Plotting](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/plotting.html): Integrated with Pandas for quick and easy
  plotting.

## Documentation and Resources:

- For Jupyter Notebook: Familiarize yourself with Jupyter Notebook through
  its [official documentation](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) at Jupyter's website.
- For Libraries: Ensure to review the official documentation of any library you choose to use for detailed guides and
  best practices.

## Tasks:

1. Content Type Analysis:
    - Examine the distribution of movies vs. TV shows.
    - Analyze trends over time in the type of content being added to Netflix.
2. Release Year Analysis:
    - Investigate the distribution of content by release year.
    - Identify trends in the production of new content over the years.
3. Ratings Analysis:
    - Explore the distribution of content by ratings (e.g., G, PG, PG-13, R, etc.).
    - Examine any correlation between ratings and the popularity or viewership of content.
4. Duration Analysis:
    - Calculate the average duration of movies.
    - Analyze the distribution of TV shows by the number of seasons.
5. Country-wise Content Analysis:
    - Assess the volume of content produced by different countries.
6. Director and Cast Analysis:
    - Identify directors or cast members with the most titles on Netflix.
    - Map collaboration networks among actors and directors(actors -> directors).
7. Genre Analysis:
    - Determine the most popular genres on Netflix.
    - Investigate trends in genre popularity over time.
8. Textual Analysis of Titles and Descriptions:
    - Discover common keywords in titles and descriptions.
9. Date Added Analysis:
    - Examine seasonality in adding new content (e.g., more content added during certain months).
    - Analyze trends in the growth of Netflix’s library over time.
10. Correlation Analysis:
    - Explore correlations between the duration of shows/movies and their ratings.
    - Investigate the relationship between the release year of content and its popularity or rating.

## Submission Requirements:

1. Your Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis, including comments explaining your thought process and findings.
2. A brief report summarizing your key insights and any interesting patterns or conclusions drawn from your analysis.
